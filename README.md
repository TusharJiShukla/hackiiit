# Fashion-Based E-Commerce Platform 🛍️

A full-stack fashion-focused e-commerce platform where users can register, log in, explore fashion items, and manage their personal profiles. Built using **React (frontend)** and **Node.js with Express + MySQL (backend)**.

## 🧩 Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication
- User **registration and login**
- Secure password storage using hashing
- Basic session/token support (if implemented)

### 🛒 Receipts Management
- Backend endpoint for **creating receipts** (with user_id, amount, description, date)
- Receipt storage in MySQL (still resolving field mismatch bugs)

### 📄 Pages Added
- `Home.jsx` – landing page
- `Login.jsx` – user login
- `Register.jsx` – user registration
- `Profile.jsx` – user info and settings
- `FashionAPI.jsx` – fetch/display fashion-related products (API integration)
